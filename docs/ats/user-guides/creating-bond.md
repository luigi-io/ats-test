# Creating Bond Tokens

Learn how to create bond tokens representing debt securities with maturity dates and coupon payments using the ATS web application.

## Overview

Bond tokens represent debt securities issued by companies or organizations. They include features like:

* Fixed maturity date for principal redemption
* Periodic coupon (interest) payments to bondholders
* Transfer restrictions and compliance rules
* Configurable payment schedules and terms

## Prerequisites

* ATS web application running and accessible
* Hedera wallet connected (HashPack, Blade, or MetaMask)
* Sufficient HBAR for transaction fees
* Business Logic Resolver and Factory contracts deployed

## Getting Started

1. Open the ATS web application
2. Click "Create Token" in the navigation menu
3. Select "Bond" as the token type

## Step 1: Bond Details

### General Information

**Name**: The full name of your bond security

* Example: "Acme Corporation 5-Year Bond"
* Include issuer name and key terms

**Symbol**: A short ticker symbol (2-8 characters)

* Example: "ACME-BOND" or "ACME5Y"
* Recommended format: `[ISSUER]-[TYPE][TERM]`

**Decimals**: Number of decimal places for bond units

* Typical value: 6 (allows fractional bonds)
* Use 0 for whole bonds only
* Use higher values (6-8) for institutional-grade bonds

**ISIN**: International Securities Identification Number

* Format: 2-letter country code + 9 alphanumeric characters + 1 check digit
* Example: `US9311421039`
* Must follow the ISO 6166 standard format
* Required for regulatory compliance and international trading

### Bond Permissions

Configure administrative permissions for the bond token:

**Controllable**

* **Purpose**: Enable forced transfers and balance adjustments
* **When enabled**: Grants CONTROLLER\_ROLE the ability to:
  * Force transfer bonds between accounts (e.g., court orders)
  * Adjust balances for regulatory compliance
  * Execute restructuring operations
* **Use cases**: Debt restructuring, regulatory requirements, lost key recovery
* **Recommendation**: Enable only if required by regulation or corporate policies

**Blocklist (Blacklist)**

* **Purpose**: Block specific addresses from holding bonds
* **How it works**: Addresses on the list cannot receive or hold bond tokens
* **Use cases**: Sanctioned entities, defaulted bondholders, regulatory blacklists
* **When to use**: When you want to block specific addresses but allow everyone else

**Approval list (Whitelist)**

* **Purpose**: Only approved addresses can hold bonds
* **How it works**: Only addresses on the list can receive bond tokens
* **Use cases**: Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), accredited investors only
* **When to use**: When you want to restrict bond ownership to pre-approved addresses only

> **Important**: You must choose **either** blocklist **or** approval list (whitelist), not both. They are mutually exclusive options.

### Bond Configuration

**Clearing Mode Enabled**

* **Purpose**: Require validator approval for all transfers and redeems
* **What it does**:
  * Users must submit transfer/redeem requests
  * Validators (CLEARING\_VALIDATOR\_ROLE) must approve before execution
  * Enables regulatory oversight of all token movements
* **When to enable**:
  * Regulatory compliance requires approval workflow
  * Jurisdiction-specific rules need validation
  * Manual review required for transfers
* **Roles activated**: CLEARING\_ROLE, CLEARING\_VALIDATOR\_ROLE

> **Learn more**: See [Clearing Operations](clearing-operations.md) for complete guide on using clearing mode.

**Internal KYC Activated**

* **Purpose**: Enable/disable internal KYC verification
* **Flag**: Controls whether token uses its own KYC registry
* **When enabled**: Token checks internal KYC registry before allowing transfers
* **When disabled**: Only external KYC lists and SSI are checked
* **Use cases**:
  * Enable: Use token's own bondholder verification database
  * Disable: Rely entirely on external KYC providers or SSI

> **Tip**: You can use Internal KYC + External KYC Lists + SSI simultaneously. Any method granting KYC allows the transfer.

## Step 2: Bond Configuration

### Bond Terms

**Currency**

* **Value**: USD (US Dollar)
* **Purpose**: Currency for bond denomination and payments
* **Note**: Currently fixed to USD, cannot be changed. All coupon payments and redemptions use USD

**Number of Bond Units**

* **Definition**: Total number of bond units to issue
* **Example**: 10,000 bonds
* **Considerations**:
  * Smaller issuances: 100-1,000 bonds
  * Medium issuances: 1,000-100,000 bonds
  * Large issuances: 100,000+ bonds
* **Note**: With decimals enabled, each unit can be fractional

**Nominal Value (Face Value)**

* **Definition**: Par value of each bond unit
* **Example**: $1,000 per bond (standard corporate bond)
* **Common values**:
  * Corporate bonds: $1,000 or $5,000
  * Government bonds: $1,000, $5,000, $10,000
  * Institutional bonds: $100,000 or $1,000,000
* **Use**: Determines principal amount paid at maturity

**Total Value**

* **Calculation**: Automatically computed
* **Formula**: Number of Bond Units × Nominal Value
* **Example**: 10,000 bonds × $1,000 = $10,000,000 total value
* **Note**: This is the total principal amount to be raised

### Bond Dates

**Starting Date (Mint Date)**

* **Definition**: Date when bonds are issued and start accruing interest
* **Also called**: Issue date, settlement date
* **Considerations**:
  * Must be present or future date
  * First coupon period starts from this date
* **Use**: Determines when bondholders can start trading

**Maturity Date**

* **Definition**: Date when bond principal is redeemed
* **Requirements**: Must be after starting date
* **Considerations**:
  * Short-term: 1-3 years
  * Medium-term: 3-10 years
  * Long-term: 10+ years
* **Use**: Determines when ISSUER must repay principal to bondholders

> **Important**: Coupon payment schedule is configured separately through the Corporate Actions interface after deployment.

## Step 3: Proceed Recipients

Proceed recipients are addresses that receive funds when bonds are issued or sold. This is optional but commonly used for treasury management.

### What are Proceed Recipients?

* **Purpose**: Automatically distribute bond proceeds to designated addresses
* **Use cases**:
  * Treasury wallet receives proceeds
  * Multi-signature wallets for corporate governance
  * Split proceeds between operating and reserve accounts
  * Escrow arrangements

### Adding Recipients

**Address**

* **Format**: Hedera Account ID (`0.0.xxxxxxx`) or EVM address (`0x...`)
* **Example**: `0.0.1234567` or `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e`
* **Validation**: Must be valid Hedera account or EVM address

**Data**

* **Purpose**: Optional field for notes or reference information
* **Format**: Free text field
* **Example**: `Treasury wallet`, `Operating account`, `Reserve fund`
* **Note**: This is for informational purposes only

### Proceed Recipients Table

After adding recipients, they appear in a table:

| Address     | Data              | Actions |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 0.0.1234567 | Treasury wallet   | Remove  |
| 0.0.7654321 | Operating account | Remove  |

**Actions Available:**

* **Remove**: Delete a recipient from the list

> **Tip**: You can add multiple recipients to receive bond proceeds.

## Step 4: ERC-3643 Integration (Optional)

For advanced compliance features, integrate ERC-3643 (T-REX) contracts. This step is **optional** but provides enhanced regulatory compliance capabilities for bond offerings.

> **Note**: Bond tokens created by ATS are **already compatible** with ERC-3643 operations by default. ATS implements **partial ERC-3643 (T-REX) compliance** as part of its core architecture. This integration step is only required if you need **full ERC-3643 standard compatibility** with advanced T-REX features like custom Compliance Modules and Identity Registries. See [Developer Guide: ATS Contracts](../developer-guides/contracts/index.md) for architecture details.

### Compliance Module

**Purpose**: Enforces transfer rules and regulatory requirements

* **What it does**: Validates all bond transfers against compliance rules
* **Use cases**:
  * Complex regulatory requirements for cross-border bonds
  * Multi-jurisdiction debt offerings
  * Institutional-grade compliance
* **Configuration**: Requires deploying a Compliance Module contract

### Identity Registry

**Purpose**: Manages verified bondholder identities

* **What it does**: Maintains on-chain registry of verified bondholder identities
* **Use cases**:
  * Enhanced KYC management for bondholders
  * Investor identity verification
  * Regulatory reporting requirements
* **Configuration**: Requires deploying an Identity Registry contract

> **Important**: Both Compliance Module and Identity Registry must be deployed before token creation. See [Deployment Guide](../developer-guides/contracts/deployment.md) for instructions.

### When to Use ERC-3643

Use this step only if you need **full compatibility with the** [**ERC-3643 standard**](https://www.erc3643.org/):

* **Standard compliance**: Need to ensure full compatibility with ERC-3643 (T-REX) specification
* **Interoperability**: Bond token must work with other ERC-3643 compliant systems
* **Third-party integrations**: Integration with platforms that require ERC-3643 compliance
* **Ecosystem compatibility**: Participating in ERC-3643 token ecosystems

### When to Skip

* **Most use cases**: ATS already provides partial ERC-3643 compliance for typical bond token operations
* **Custom compliance**: If you just need complex compliance, use ATS's built-in features (Internal KYC, External KYC Lists, Control Lists, Clearing Mode, etc.)
* **Testing/Development**: Prototyping bond structures without standard requirements

## Step 5: External Lists Configuration

In this step, you can link previously created external lists to your bond token. These are optional but recommended for multi-token issuers.

### External Pause Lists

External pause contracts allow coordinated pausing across multiple bonds:

* **What are they**: On-chain smart contracts that can pause all linked bonds
* **Where to configure**: Sidebar menu → External Pause
* **Use cases**: Platform-wide emergency stops, coordinated system upgrades, crisis management
* **How it works**: If any linked pause contract returns `isPaused() = true`, bond is paused
* **Link**: [Managing External Pause Lists](managing-external-pause-lists.md)

**How to link:**

1. **Select from dropdown**: All your created pause contracts appear
2. **Add to token**: Click to link pause mechanism
3. **View linked**: See all currently linked pause contracts
4. **Remove**: Unlink if no longer needed

### External Control Lists

External control lists are reusable whitelists/blacklists shared across multiple bonds:

* **What are they**: On-chain smart contracts managing approved/blocked addresses
* **Where to configure**: Sidebar menu → Control Lists
* **Use cases**: Shared regulatory blacklists, multi-bond whitelists for institutional investors
* **Link**: [Managing External Control Lists](managing-external-control-lists.md)

**How to link:**

1. **Select from dropdown**: All your created control lists appear
2. **Add to token**: Click to link whitelist or blacklist
3. **View linked**: See all currently linked control lists
4. **Remove**: Unlink if no longer needed

### External KYC Lists

External KYC lists verify bondholder identity across multiple bonds:

* **What are they**: On-chain smart contracts managing KYC-verified investors
* **Where to configure**: Sidebar menu → External KYC
* **Use cases**: Shared bondholder verification, third-party KYC providers, institutional investor registries
* **Link**: [Managing External KYC Lists](managing-external-kyc-lists.md)

**How to link:**

1. **Select from dropdown**: All your created KYC lists appear
2. **Add to token**: Click to link KYC verification list
3. **View linked**: See all currently linked KYC lists
4. **Remove**: Unlink if no longer needed

> **Tip**: You can create external lists from the sidebar before or after bond creation.

## Step 6: Regulation

> **Important**: Consult your legal and financial advisor for regulations applicable to your bond offering.

### Jurisdiction

The primary jurisdiction for your bond offering:

* **United States**

### Select Regulation

![ATS Dashboard](../../../.gitbook/assets/ats-web-tabs.png)

> **Note**: Available tabs depend on your assigned roles. See [Roles and Permissions](roles-and-permissions.md).

## Managing Your Bond Token

After creation, you can manage your bond from the dashboard. Select **Admin View (green)** to access administrative operations or **Holder View (blue)** to view balances and transfer tokens.

Common bond lifecycle management operations:

### Distribute Bonds

* **How**: Transfer tab or issue function
* **Requirements**: ISSUER\_ROLE
* **Recipients**: Must pass KYC and control list checks
* **Use cases**: Initial bond distribution to underwriters, direct sales to investors

### Execute Coupon Payments

* **How**: Corporate Actions tab → Create Coupon Payment
* **Requirements**: CORPORATE\_ACTION\_ROLE
* **Process**:
  1. Create snapshot of bondholders at record date
  2. Specify coupon amount (interest payment)
  3. Execute distribution to all bondholders
* **Frequency**: Based on bond terms (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually)

### Handle Maturity Redemption

* **How**: Corporate Actions tab → Maturity Redemption
* **Requirements**: CORPORATE\_ACTION\_ROLE
* **Process**:
  1. At maturity date, create final snapshot
  2. Calculate principal + final coupon
  3. Execute redemption to all bondholders
  4. Bond tokens are burned upon redemption

### Manage Compliance

* **KYC**: Grant/revoke KYC status for bondholders
* **Control Lists**: Add/remove addresses from whitelist/blacklist
* **Freeze**: Freeze specific bondholder accounts if needed (regulatory requirements)

### Pause Transfers

* **How**: Settings → Emergency pause
* **Requirements**: PAUSER\_ROLE
* **Effect**: All bond transfers blocked until unpause
* **Use cases**: Security incidents, regulatory investigations, system maintenance

## Common Issues

### Transaction Failed

* **Insufficient HBAR**: Ensure wallet has enough HBAR for gas fees (check estimated cost)
* **Invalid Configuration**: Verify all required fields are filled correctly
* **Contract Not Found**: Check Factory contract address in your .env configuration
* **Invalid Dates**: Ensure maturity date is after starting date

### Proceed Recipients Errors

* **Percentages don't add to 100%**: Verify all recipient allocations sum to 100%
* **Invalid Address**: Check that addresses are valid Hedera IDs or EVM addresses
* **Duplicate Recipients**: Remove duplicate addresses before deployment

### KYC Errors

* **KYC check fails**: Verify bondholder is KYC-verified (internal, external, or SSI)
* **External list not found**: Ensure external KYC list address is correct
* **SSI not configured**: If using SSI, verify revocation registry and issuers are set

### Transfer Restrictions

* **Blocklist blocking**: Check if recipient is on blocklist (internal or external)
* **Approval list missing**: If approval list enabled, ensure recipient is approved
* **Regulation block**: Verify recipient's jurisdiction is not blocked

### Control List Issues

* **Internal vs External**: Remember both internal and external lists are checked
* **Wrong list type**: Verify you're using control lists (not KYC lists) for transfer control

### Bond Lifecycle Issues

* **Coupon payment failed**: Ensure sufficient funds in payment token contract
* **Maturity date misconfigured**: Verify maturity date is set correctly during creation
* **Missing CORPORATE\_ACTION\_ROLE**: Grant role to accounts responsible for coupon payments
