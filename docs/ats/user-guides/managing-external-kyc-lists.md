# Managing External KYC Lists

Learn how to configure and manage external KYC lists for investor identity verification across multiple tokens.

## Overview

External KYC lists are on-chain smart contracts that provide centralized KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for your security tokens. They allow you to:

* Manage KYC-verified investors across multiple tokens
* Share KYC verification between different securities
* Integrate with external compliance providers
* Maintain compliance state independently from token contracts

## What are External KYC Lists?

External KYC lists verify investor identity and accreditation status:

* **Purpose**: Centralized KYC verification for multiple tokens
* **Benefits**: Reusable across different securities, easier to maintain
* **Interface**: Implements `IExternalKycList.isGranted(address)`
* **Use case**: When managing multiple tokens with the same investor base

### Key Difference from Internal KYC

* **Internal KYC**: Each token maintains its own KYC registry
* **External KYC**: Shared KYC registry used by multiple tokens
* **Flexibility**: Tokens can use internal, external, or both

## Accessing External KYC Lists

1. Navigate to the ATS web application
2. Click on **"External KYC"** in the sidebar menu

## Creating or Importing External KYC Lists

You have two options to add an external KYC list:

### Option 1: Create New KYC List

Creates a new external KYC list by deploying a smart contract automatically.

**Steps:**

1. Click **"Create"** button
2. Provide list details:
   * **List Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "US Accredited Investors")
   * **Description** (optional): Purpose and coverage of this list
3. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Create"**
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet
5. The contract is deployed and appears in your External KYC list

**What happens:**

* A new external KYC contract is deployed on-chain
* You become the manager of this KYC list
* The contract address is displayed (0x... or 0.0.xxxxx)
* You can now add investors and link this list to your tokens

### Option 2: Import Existing KYC List

Use an existing external KYC list by importing its contract ID.

**Steps:**

1. Click **"Import"** button
2. Enter the **Contract ID**: Hedera contract ID (0.0.xxxxx) or EVM address (0x...)
3. Click **"Import"**
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet
5. The external KYC list appears in your list

**Use cases:**

* Use a KYC list deployed by another team member
* Connect to a third-party KYC provider's list
* Share KYC lists across multiple organizations

> **Note**: When importing, you may have view-only access unless you have admin permissions on the imported contract.

## Linking External KYC Lists to Tokens

After creating or importing an external KYC list, you need to link it to your security tokens.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to your **security token** from the dashboard
2. Go to the **"Control"** tab
3. Select the **"External KYC"** section
4. Click **"Add External KYC"** button
5. Select the external KYC list from the dropdown
6. Click **"Add"** to confirm
7. Approve the transaction in your wallet

> **Required Role**: You must have **KYC\_MANAGER\_ROLE** on the token to link external KYC lists.

## Managing KYC List Members

Once you have created or imported a KYC list, you can manage investors in it.

### Viewing Accounts

To view all accounts in the KYC list:

1. Navigate to the external KYC list from the sidebar
2. Select the list you want to view
3. Click the **magnifying glass icon** (🔍)
4. View the list of all accounts in this KYC list

### Adding Members

To add an account to the KYC list:

1. Navigate to the external KYC list
2. Click the **user with plus icon** (👤➕)
3. Enter the account address (Hedera ID or EVM address)
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Approve the transaction

### Removing Members

To remove an account from the KYC list:

1. Navigate to the external KYC list
2. Click the **user with minus icon** (👤➖)
3. Enter the account address to remove
4. Click **"Remove"**
5. Approve the transaction

### Deleting the KYC List

To delete an entire external KYC list:

1. Navigate to the external KYC list
2. Click the **trash icon** (🗑️)
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Approve the transaction

**Important**: When you delete an external KYC list, it will be automatically removed from all security tokens that are using it. This affects all linked tokens immediately.

## Managing Multiple KYC Lists

### Using Multiple External KYC Lists

A token can use multiple external KYC lists simultaneously:

* An investor is considered verified if they appear in **any** linked KYC list
* Example: Combine "US Investors" list with "EU Investors" list
* All lists are checked via `isExternallyGranted()` function

### How Verification Works

When checking if an investor is KYC verified:

1. **Internal KYC checked first** (if `internalKYCActivated` is true)
2. **External KYC lists checked** (any grant wins)
3. **SSI credentials checked** (if configured)
4. **Result**: Investor passes if **any** method grants KYC

## Required Roles

To manage external KYC lists:

* **KYC\_MANAGER\_ROLE**: Add/remove external KYC lists from token
* **DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE**: Full administrative access

For the external KYC list contract itself:

* Contract deployer controls who can add/remove investors

See the [Roles and Permissions Guide](roles-and-permissions.md) for details.

## Smart Contract Interface

External KYC list contracts must implement:

```solidity
interface IExternalKycList {
  function isGranted(address account) external view returns (bool);
}
```

Returns:

* `true`: Account is KYC granted
* `false`: Account is not KYC granted

## Best Practices

### Security

* **Regular audits**: Review list members periodically
* **Role separation**: Different admins for KYC management
* **Transaction verification**: Always verify addresses before adding

### Compliance

* **Documentation**: Maintain off-chain records of KYC verification
* **Revocation process**: Have clear procedures for revoking KYC
* **Data privacy**: External lists only store addresses and status, not PII

### Performance

* **Batch operations**: Use bulk import for large lists
* **Pagination**: Query large lists in pages to avoid timeouts
* **Shared lists**: Reuse KYC lists across multiple tokens to reduce costs

## Troubleshooting

### List Not Recognized

If your token doesn't recognize an external KYC list:

* Verify the list contract address is correct
* Ensure the list is properly linked to the token
* Check that you have KYC\_MANAGER\_ROLE
* Verify the list contract implements `IExternalKycList` interface

### KYC Status Not Updating

* Confirm the transaction was successfully mined
* Check that you have the required role
* Verify the investor address format is correct
* Ensure the external list is active (not removed)

### Transaction Failed

* **Insufficient HBAR**: Ensure wallet has enough for gas fees
* **Permission denied**: Verify you have the required role (KYC\_MANAGER\_ROLE)
* **Invalid address**: Check address format and checksum
* **Already added**: KYC list may already be linked to token

## Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Token KYC Management

**Scenario**: Issuer has 10 different equity tokens

**Solution**:

* Create one external KYC list
* Link to all 10 tokens
* Manage KYC in one place

**Benefits**: Single source of truth, reduced management overhead

### 2. Regulatory Compliance

**Scenario**: Financial regulator maintains approved investor list

**Solution**:

* Regulator deploys external KYC list
* Issuers link their tokens to regulator's list
* Regulator updates list as needed

**Benefits**: Automatic compliance with regulatory changes

### 3. Third-Party KYC Provider

**Scenario**: Use external KYC verification service

**Solution**:

* KYC provider deploys external KYC list
* Provider updates list based on their verification
* Tokens link to provider's list

**Benefits**: Professional KYC verification, reduced liability
