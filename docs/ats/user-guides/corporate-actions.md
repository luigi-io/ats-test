### Balance Adjustments (Stock Splits)

Adjust token balances for all holders (e.g., 2-for-1 stock split or 1-for-2 reverse split).

#### Accessing Balance Adjustments

1. Navigate to your equity token
2. Select **Admin View (green)**
3. Go to **Corporate Actions** → **Balance Adjustments**

#### Programming a Balance Adjustment

1. Click **"New Balance Adjustment"**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Execution Date**: Select date using date picker

     - For 2:1 split, enter `2`
     - For 1:2 reverse split, enter `0.5`
3. Click **"Schedule"**
4. Approve the transaction

**Example**: If a holder has 100 tokens and you apply a factor of `2`, they will have 200 tokens after execution.

> **⚠️ Important — Backend Balance Alignment:**
> When a balance adjustment execution date is reached, the on-chain view methods
> (`balanceOf`) will immediately reflect the adjusted amounts. However, no event is
> emitted until the next on-chain operation (e.g., a transfer or issue) is executed for
> that account. During this window, backend systems that track balances exclusively via
> events may show balances that do not match on-chain state. Backend systems should
> periodically reconcile with on-chain view methods around scheduled execution dates.

### Voting Rights

Program voting events for equity holders.

#### Accessing Voting Rights

1. Navigate to your equity token
2. Select **Admin View (green)**
3. Go to **Corporate Actions** → **Voting Rights**

   - **Execution Date**: Select voting date using date picker
3. Click **"Create"**
4. Approve the transaction

#### Viewing Voting Events

The voting rights table displays scheduled voting events with their execution dates.
