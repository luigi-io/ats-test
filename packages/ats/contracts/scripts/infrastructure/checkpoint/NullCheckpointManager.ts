/**
 * No-op checkpoint manager for test environments.
 *
 * Extends CheckpointManager but overrides all filesystem operations to be
 * no-ops. Checkpoints are created in memory but never persisted to disk.
 *
 * **Performance Benefits:**
 * - Eliminates filesystem I/O during test execution
 * - Prevents checkpoint file accumulation
 * - Avoids race conditions in parallel test execution
 * - Reduces test initialization overhead by ~500-1000ms per test
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In deployment workflow
 * const checkpointManager = ignoreCheckpoint
 *   ? new NullCheckpointManager()
 *   : new CheckpointManager(checkpointDir);
 *
 * // Checkpoint operations work but don't touch filesystem
 * const checkpoint = checkpointManager.createCheckpoint({ ... });
 * await checkpointManager.saveCheckpoint(checkpoint); // No-op
 * ```
