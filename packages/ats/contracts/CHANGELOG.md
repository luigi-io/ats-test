# @hashgraph/asset-tokenization-contracts

## 5.0.0

### Patch Changes

- f809d77: Fix downstream project compatibility for contracts package:
  - Convert 454 bare `contracts/` prefix imports to relative imports across 250 Solidity files; relative imports work universally across Hardhat, Foundry, and downstream consumers
  - Reorganize test utilities into dedicated files (`helpers/assertions.ts`, `fixtures/hardhatHelpers.ts`) and expose via new `./test/fixtures` export entry point for downstream test reuse
  - Add `isDeployable` field to `ContractMetadata` in registry generator to correctly distinguish deployable contracts from interfaces/libraries; only deployable mocks generate TypeChain factory references
  - Include test helpers and fixtures in published package build output (`tsconfig.build.json`)
  - Re-enable `use-natspec` solhint rule

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5de99bd: Move SecurityFacet to layer_2

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c5b2a50: Add support for multiple bond types (Variable Rate, Fixed Rate, KPI Linked, SPT)

  This release introduces comprehensive support for multiple bond asset types across the Asset Tokenization Studio:

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - Refactored Solidity contracts to check for Equity type instead of Bond type, as Bond is no longer a single type but a family of types (Variable Rate, Fixed Rate, KPI Linked Rate, SPT Rate)
  - Updated asset type filtering logic to use enum values (BOND_VARIABLE_RATE, BOND_FIXED_RATE, BOND_KPI_LINKED_RATE, BOND_SPT_RATE, EQUITY) instead of display strings

  **Contract Changes:**
  - Updated LifeCycleCashFlowStorageWrapper.sol to invert AssetType checks: now validates if asset is Equity (special case) with bond types as the default behavior
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all bond types in lifecycle cash flow tests

  **SDK Changes:**
  - Extended asset type system to support four distinct bond types plus equity
  - Maintained backward compatibility for existing integrations

  This is a **minor** version bump as it adds new functionality (multiple bond types) while maintaining backward compatibility through the enum-based approach.

- a942765: Migrate totalSupply and balances to ERC20 storage with lazy migration strategy

  This PR introduces a storage migration that moves `totalSupply` and `balances` from the legacy ERC1410BasicStorage to the new ERC20Storage, enabling better separation of concerns and improved gas efficiency.

  **Key Changes:**
  - **New Storage Structure**: Added `totalSupply` and `balances` fields to ERC20Storage struct in ERC20StorageWrapper1
  - **Lazy Migration**: Implemented `_migrateTotalSupplyIfNeeded()` and `_migrateBalanceIfNeeded()` functions that automatically migrate values from deprecated storage on first access
  - **Migration Triggers**: `_adjustTotalSupply` and `_adjustTotalBalanceFor` call `_migrateTotalSupplyIfNeeded` and `_migrateBalanceIfNeeded` respectively, ensuring migration is triggered during balance adjustment operations
  - **Backward Compatibility**: View functions prioritize legacy storage values, falling back to new storage when legacy is empty
  - **Deprecated Fields**: Renamed `_totalSupply_` to `DEPRECATED_totalSupply` and `_balances_` to `DEPRECATED_balances` in ERC1410BasicStorage to indicate deprecation
  - **Event Emission**: Simplified Transfer event emission by replacing internal `_emitTransferEvent` wrapper with direct `emit Transfer` statements
  - **New Helper Methods**: Added `_increaseBalance`, `_reduceBalance`, `_increaseTotalSupply`, `_reduceTotalSupply`, and `_adjustTotalBalanceFor` functions
  - **Migration Test Contract**: Added MigrationFacetTest for testing the migration scenarios
  - **Integration Tests**: Added `adjustBalances` integration tests verifying that `adjustBalances` migrates `totalSupply` eagerly and that per-account balance migration is triggered lazily on the next token interaction

  **Benefits:**
  - Cleaner storage architecture with ERC20-specific data in ERC20Storage
  - Automatic, transparent migration with no disruption to existing tokens
  - Small gas savings from simplified event emission (~50-70 gas per transfer operation)

## 3.0.0

### Minor Changes

- e0a3f03: Add bytes operationData to ClearingOperationApproved event in case of creating a new hold to send the holdId or to be used by other operation in the future

### Patch Changes

- e0a3f03: fix: CI workflow improvements for reliable releases
  1. **Fixed --ignore pattern in ats.release.yml**: Changed from non-existent
     `@hashgraph/mass-payout*` to correct `@mass-payout/*` package namespace
  2. **Simplified publish trigger in ats.publish.yml**: Changed from
     `release: published` to `push.tags` for automatic publishing on tag push
     (no need to manually create GitHub release)
  3. **Removed recursive publish scripts**: Removed `"publish": "npm publish"`
     from contracts and SDK package.json files that caused npm to recursively
     call itself during publish lifecycle, resulting in 403 errors in CI

- e0a3f03: Lock and Clearing operations now trigger account balance snapshots. Frozen balance at snapshots methods created

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- c62eb6e: **BREAKING:** Nominal value decimals added to Bonds and Equities

  Nominal value decimals must now be provided when deploying new Bonds/Equities and must be retrieved when reading the nominal value. This change ensures consistent decimal handling across the platform.

### Minor Changes

- c62eb6e: Refactor deployment scripts into modular infrastructure/domain architecture with framework-agnostic provider pattern and automated registry generation

  - Deployment scripts API changed: operations now require `DeploymentProvider` parameter
  - Import paths changed to `@scripts/infrastructure` and `@scripts/domain` aliases
  - Removed legacy command/query/result patterns and monolithic scripts
  - Scripts reorganized: infrastructure/ (generic, reusable) and domain/ (ATS-specific)

  **Architecture:**
  - Infrastructure/Domain Separation with DeploymentProvider interface
  - Provider implementations for Hardhat and Standalone Node.js
  - Modular operations and workflow compositions

  **Registry System Enhancements:**
  - Automated generation with event/error deduplication
  - Expanded metadata: 49 facets, 2 infrastructure contracts, 29 storage wrappers, 28 unique roles
  - Zero warnings with TimeTravelFacet correctly excluded

  **Performance:**
  - Full build: 43.5s → 45.3s (+1.8s, 4% overhead)
  - Net code reduction: 2,947 lines across 175 files

- c62eb6e: Export missing utilities and enhance deployment tracking

  Exported utilities: Hedera integration, deployment file management, verification, selector generation, transparent proxy deployment, and bond token deployment from factory. Enhanced deployment workflows with better tracking for BLR implementation and explicit contract IDs.

- c62eb6e: Full redeem at maturity method added to bond lifecycle management

- c62eb6e: Bond and Equity storage layout updated to avoid breaking changes and maintain consistency with previous versions

- c62eb6e: Dividend Amount For methods added for equity dividend calculations

- c62eb6e: Coupon Amount For and Principal For methods added for bond payment calculations

### Patch Changes
